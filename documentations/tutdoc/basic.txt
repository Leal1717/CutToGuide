there are some rules to create shapes to make the game more interesting

number 1 you can only start with green points to create a shape and not with red points
and also used green points will turn red

(create a normal shape[13]to[1])
    this is valid
(join [13] to [2])
    this is not because i started with a red point
(join [2] to [13])
    and this is valid because i stated with a green point
    (join[3]to [13])
    and you can join any possible green point like this

numeber 2
(overlap cut the shape)
    use cant overpal cut the two shapes
and number 3
(internal cutting)
    you cant do internal cutting

to make this all easier and not complex
you just need to draw the shape if its valid it will be outlined in blue lines
and it its invalid nothing will happen
(draw some shapes)

Remember you can cut shapes once only when you come here all shapes from the level are restated so be carefull

(highlight back)
when you are done with shapes go back by touching here

as you can see the shapes are layed like this in the grid
